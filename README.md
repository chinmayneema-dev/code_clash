# Question 1
To solve the problem of counting "magical subarrays," we use the prefix sum technique combined with modular arithmetic:

Prefix Sum: Calculate the cumulative sum of elements up to each index.
Modulo Condition: For each prefix sum, calculate the remainder when divided by k. A subarray sum is divisible by k if the remainders of its starting and ending prefix sums are equal.
Hash Map: Maintain a hash map to track how many times each remainder has occurred. This allows counting valid subarrays in constant time.
Counting Valid Subarrays: As we traverse the array, for each element, we update the prefix sum, compute the modulo k, and check how many times the same remainder has occurred before.
Efficiency: This approach works in O(n) time, as we traverse the array once and use hash map operations (constant time) for each element.

# Question 2
To solve this problem using the BFS approach:

Treat each word as a node in a graph, where edges exist between words that differ by exactly one letter.
Start BFS from the start word and explore all possible transformations, changing one letter at a time.
Use a queue to store the current word and its transformation level, and a set to store valid words (the dictionary).
For each word, generate all possible valid transformations by replacing each letter with every letter from 'a' to 'z'.
If the transformed word matches the target, return the current transformation level + 1.
If BFS completes without finding the target, return -1.
This approach ensures the shortest transformation sequence due to the properties of BFS.

# Question  3
To solve this problem, we need to sort integers based on their binary representation in lexicographical order. Here's the approach:

Convert each integer into its binary string representation, removing any leading zeros to ensure proper lexicographical comparison.
Pair each integer with its binary representation so that we can later sort the list based on the binary strings.
Use a stable sorting algorithm to sort these pairs by the binary string. Stability ensures that integers with the same binary representation maintain their original order.
After sorting, extract the integers from the sorted pairs and output them in the required order.
The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n), where n is the number of integers.

# Question 4
To solve this problem, we use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest transformation sequence from the beginWord to the endWord:

First, sort the word list lexicographically and filter out words with odd indices (only even-indexed words are valid for transformation).
Treat each word as a node in a graph where edges exist between words that differ by exactly one letter.
Use BFS starting from the beginWord, checking if a word can transform into another by changing exactly one letter.
Maintain a visited set to avoid revisiting words and a queue to explore all possible transformations.
If we reach the endWord, return the number of transformations; if no valid sequence exists, return 0.
The BFS ensures that we find the shortest transformation sequence because it explores all possible transformations level by level.

# Question 5
The approach for solving this problem is as follows:

Feasibility Check: If w < n-1, it's impossible to arrange all meetings, so we return "infinity".
Minimizing Isolation: We calculate the minimum isolation using the formula (w + n - 2) / (n - 1), which helps to spread out meetings as evenly as possible.
Cyclic Scheduling: We use a round-robin strategy to assign team members to the office in a cyclic pattern over w weeks, ensuring that each pair of members from different teams meets at least once.
Output: If feasible, output the minimum isolation and then the schedule for each week, where each team sends one of its two members to the office.
This ensures minimal isolation and meets the requirement of all pairs meeting within the available weeks.
